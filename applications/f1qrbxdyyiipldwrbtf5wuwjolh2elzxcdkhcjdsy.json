    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "My Own Storage Infra",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "Prepping data for Filecoin is straightforward: First, pack your data into a CAR file (a format built for IPLD), then generate its Piece CID and CAR file CID—these act like unique fingerprints. Next, use lotus client deal to propose a storage deal, splitting the CAR file into \"pieces\" (properly sized chunks, aligned to powers of two). Once a miner accepts, the data gets transferred via P2P, and the deal finalizes on-chain.\n\nTL;DR: Pack → hash → split → propose → transfer. Keep an eye on the CommP (data’s unique ID) and Deal ID, or you might lose track.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "http://cnqianjing.cn/case/",
