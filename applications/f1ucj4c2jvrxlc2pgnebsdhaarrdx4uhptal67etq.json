    "Brief history of your project and organization": "The National Microbiology Data Center (NMDC) was officially announced in June 2019 by the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Ministry of Finance. It is hosted by the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in collaboration with multiple entities including the Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The superior administrative departments are the National Science and Technology Infrastructure Center of the Ministry of Science and Technology and the General Office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\r\n\r\nThe data resources at the center exceed 2PB in total volume, with more than 4 billion records. The content comprehensively covers all aspects of microbiology research lifecycle, including microbial resources, microbiological and interdisciplinary methodologies, research processes and engineering, microbiome studies, microbial technologies, as well as literature, patents, experts, achievements, and other information related to microbiology.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The various databases encompass a wide range of resources, such as the Type Bacterial Sequenced Genomes Database, the Standard Strain Resources Catalog, the China Biotechnology Information Network, the Chinese Academy of Sciences Strategic Biological Resources Program, the Plant Quarantine Fungal Database, the Human Gut Microbiome Genome, the Global Pathogen Microorganism Directory, the Fungal Microorganisms List, the COVID-19 Virus Variant Early Warning System, and the Toxic Mushroom Characterization and Genomics Database. These platforms serve to aggregate and provide access to critical biological and microbiological information for research and public health purposes.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "No response",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://nmdc.cn/monitor/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[X] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "More than 3 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, Africa, North America, South America, Europe, Australia (continent), Antarctica",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f03202108 \r\nf03239692 \r\nf03254235",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
